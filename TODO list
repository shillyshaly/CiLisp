CHECK LIST:
figure out why tokens aren't get passed
finish the math functions
    make sure to check for number of ops
finish "evalFunctionNode"


QUESTIONS:
do we have to create things like push and pop functions?


BUGS:
-not passing arguments through the program
    I'm pretty sure it's not printing because i'm not pushing anything onto a stack for processing
-adding to expression list not completed properly
    I'm not sure if i have to create push/pop style functions or if i can just do it all in the function
    call itself.  prop the function call???

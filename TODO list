CHECK LIST:
-figure out why tokens aren't get passed
-finish the math functions
    have to check for number of ops
-finish evalFunctionNode
-finish free node functions


QUESTIONS:
-i'm missing something... nothing being passed.  bison shows that the numbers are being seen
    and the function tokens are correct, but it is not being saved somewhere it seems.
    maybe the it's not taking the right path in yacc???
    --wasn't returning anything in evalFunc call
-do we have to create things like push and pop functions?
    --no
-how are we to do remainder? what do we have to return?


BUGS:
TASK 1:
+not passing arguments through the program
    I'm pretty sure it's not printing because i'm not pushing anything onto a stack for processing
    --found out I was passing pointers instead of the RET_VAL, evalFuncNode wasn't returning anything.
+adding to expression list not completed properly
    I'm not sure if i have to create push/pop style functions or if i can just do it all in the function
    call itself.  prob the function call???
    --Same as before.  no pop/push needed
+most functions still need work due to adding functions to list
    most cases not handling 0 operands correctly
    --fixed
+remainder is incorrect, divide returns wrong number, sub is incorrect
    not sure with division, if i have to make if statement based on type for int division
    remainder is not returning correct
    --sub is fine
+fix memory leaks

TASK 2:
+start everything.....
+finish .l and .y additions and debug
